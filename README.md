üõ†Ô∏è Running the Application
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

Node.js: Download Node.js
MongoDB: Install MongoDB (for local development)
Cloudinary account for file upload functionality: Create an account
1. Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mern-chat-app.git
cd mern-chat-app
2. Install dependencies

npm install
3. Set up environment variables

MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/mern-chat-app
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
CLOUDINARY_URL=your_cloudinary_url
4. Build the app

npm run build
5. Start the application
Backend

npm start
Frontend
The frontend is built into the build folder during the build process. Ensure that the frontend is correctly connected to the backend by starting both servers. You may need to adjust the proxy settings or deploy both to the same platform.

6. Access the app

http://localhost:5000
üí° Development Notes
For local development, make sure MongoDB is running, or configure it to connect to a remote MongoDB database.
For production, consider using services like Render or Heroku for deploying both the backend and frontend.
For file uploads, ensure you‚Äôve set up your Cloudinary account correctly and the API keys are configured in your .env file.


üîß Troubleshooting
Common Issues:
MongoDB connection failure: Ensure MongoDB is running locally or that you're using a cloud-based MongoDB service like Atlas.
JWT Token issues: Double-check the secret key and expiration time in your .env file.
Socket.io connection errors: Ensure the client and server are correctly connected and that both are running.
